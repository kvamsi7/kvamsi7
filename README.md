- **Experience**: 4 years working with a range of machine learning algorithms, data pipelines, and cloud-based ML deployment.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, AWS, SQL, Git, Flask, React, and more.
- **Passion**: I‚Äôm passionate about developing intelligent systems that not only solve technical challenges but also improve the way people interact with technology.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies & Tools

Here are some of the tools and technologies I've worked with:

- **Programming Languages**: Python, JavaScript, SQL
- **Machine Learning & Data Science**: TensorFlow, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Numpy
- **Natural Language Processing**: Named Entity Recognition (NER), Topic Modeling, Sentiment Analysis, Transformers
- **Cloud & Deployment**: AWS (EC2, S3), Docker
- **Web Development**: React, Flask, FastAPI
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

## üöÄ Projects

Below are some of the key projects I‚Äôve worked on:

### 1. [Credit Risk Assistant](#)
   A machine learning-driven web application built to predict and assess credit risk for loan applications. Deployed on AWS for scalable, real-time predictions.

### 2. [Intelligent Ticket Routing System](#)
   An automated ticket routing system utilizing machine learning algorithms to classify and route tickets to appropriate departments without human intervention.

### 3. Voice Assistant Enhancements
   Contributed to the development of a voice assistant (like **Bixby**) with enhanced NLP features such as better response retrieval, automated backlog reports, and reduced speech recognition errors.

### 4. Chatbot using Transformers
   A conversational AI chatbot built using Transformer models to handle human-like interactions. Trained and fine-tuned to respond to user queries.
