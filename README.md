### 2. [Evaluating CoT on LLMs reasoning : Exploration and paper Implementation](https://github.com/kvamsi7/llm_cot_research)
This research works is of an in-depth exploration of Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning in Large Language Models (LLMs), focusing on its impact on solving complex reasoning tasks. The project leverages the GSM8k benchmark dataset and includes experiments with zero-shot and few-shot CoT approaches, along with the Majority Vote strategy for output reliability.

### 3. [Credit Risk Assistant](https://github.com/kvamsi7/ML-portfolio/tree/prj1/Acess%20Credit%20risk%20-%20AWS%20deployment)
   A machine learning-driven web application built to predict and assess credit risk for loan applications. Deployed on AWS for scalable, real-time predictions.

### 4. [Document Classifier](https://github.com/kvamsi7/ML-portfolio/tree/prj1/Document%20classification)
   An automated ticket routing system utilizing machine learning algorithms to classify and route tickets to appropriate departments without human intervention.

### 5. [Generate Handwritten Digit Images Using DCGAN](https://github.com/kvamsi7/ML-portfolio/blob/main/Generate-handwritten-digit-images-DCGAN/Generate_handwritten_digit_images_DCGAN.ipynb)
Developed a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) to generate realistic handwritten digit images similar to the MNIST dataset. This project demonstrates the use of adversarial training to create high-quality synthetic data.

### 6. [IMDB Reviews Sentiment Analysis Using LSTM](https://github.com/kvamsi7/ML-portfolio/blob/main/IMDB-reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-LSTM/DL_Pro_10_IMDB_reviews_Sentiment_Analysis_LSTM.ipynb)
Built a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network for sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews. The model classifies reviews as positive or negative by capturing temporal dependencies in text data.
