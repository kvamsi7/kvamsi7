## üöÄ Projects

Below are some of the key projects I‚Äôve worked on:

### 1. [Kidney Disease Classification Using Deep Learning](https://github.com/kvamsi7/kidney-disease-classification-dl-project)
This project implements a deep learning-based system for the classification of kidney diseases using medical imaging. Built to assist healthcare professionals, the solution leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyze and classify images efficiently and accurately.

### 2. [Credit Risk Assistant](https://github.com/kvamsi7/ML-portfolio/tree/prj1/Acess%20Credit%20risk%20-%20AWS%20deployment)
   A machine learning-driven web application built to predict and assess credit risk for loan applications. Deployed on AWS for scalable, real-time predictions.

### 3. [Document Classifier](https://github.com/kvamsi7/ML-portfolio/tree/prj1/Document%20classification)
   An automated ticket routing system utilizing machine learning algorithms to classify and route tickets to appropriate departments without human intervention.

<!-- ### 4. Chatbot using Transformers
   A conversational AI chatbot built using Transformer models to handle human-like interactions. Trained and fine-tuned to respond to user queries. -->
